DocumentAtom SDK Test Sample

This is a sample text file for testing the DocumentAtom SDK.
It contains multiple paragraphs to demonstrate text processing capabilities.

The DocumentAtom library is designed to break documents into "atoms" 
for AI and machine learning processing. Each atom represents a meaningful 
chunk of content that can be processed independently.

This sample file includes:
- Multiple paragraphs
- Different sentence structures
- Various punctuation marks
- Numbers and special characters: 123, 456, 789
- Mixed case text: UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case

The SDK provides a comprehensive set of methods for processing various 
document types including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, HTML, JSON, XML, 
Markdown, RTF, CSV, and plain text files.

Each document type has its own processing method that extracts atoms 
based on the document's structure and content. The atoms can then be 
used for further analysis, indexing, or machine learning tasks.

This concludes our sample text file for testing purposes.
